This is an example of an Java project with Java Native Interface (JNI),
with an associated Ant build config. You can add targets and expand on
this to build your real Java project, if you're using JNI. Or write yours
from scratch.

Directories:
-- src: Java source files
-- jni: C++ source files
-- include: Relevant java headers are automatically built here
-- classes: Auto-generated directory with built java classes

Commands:
-- ant jar: Compile and jar the src files (subset of 'hello' command).
-- ant hello: Compile the src files, then run the HelloWorld task.
-- ant clean: Deletes compiled files.
